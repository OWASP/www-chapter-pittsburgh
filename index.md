The OWASP Pittsburgh meetings are FREE and OPEN to anyone interested in learning more about application security. We encourage individuals to provide knowledge transfer via hands-on training and presentations of specific OWASP projects and research topics and sharing SDLC knowledge. The chapter is committed to providing an engaging experience for a variety of audience types ranging from local students and those beginning in Application Security, to those experienced and accomplished professionals who are looking for competent collaborators for OWASP-related projects. To this end, we will continue to conduct monthly chapter meetings application security topics.

Please review our schedule at [Meetup](https://www.meetup.com/OWASP-Pittsburgh-Chapter/) for upcoming talks.
